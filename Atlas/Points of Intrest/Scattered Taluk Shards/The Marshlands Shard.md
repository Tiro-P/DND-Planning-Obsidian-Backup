a massive shard of [[Heart Gems]] made by [[Tataluk]] in the [[Marshlands]]

Seen as the shining peak of a lone mountain stretching out of the marshlands this shard at its creation was disguised by [[Tataluk]], scooping up large portions of rock and dirt creating the nearby lake and covering the shard with a new solitary mountain. making it so the only sign of its magical origin is the shine of crystal in the places worn away by water or wind over the years.
