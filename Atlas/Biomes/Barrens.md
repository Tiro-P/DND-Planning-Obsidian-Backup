## Terrain
- Description:
	- An arid wasteland on the eastern coast of the main continent, the land here is full of canyons and sand dunes
- Landmarks:
	-  The [[Ruins of Teerai]] and its now glass wave can be seen from a great distance away shining over the dunes
	- one of the few bits of respite a traveler in the [[Barrens]] can find is [[Tastora]], the healing city woven out of the [[The Desert Shards]]
	- outside of the main attractions, interesting arches and spires carved by wind dot the otherwise plain terrain
- Challenges:
	-  The desert stretches on for a great distance on its way up to [[The Holy Sands]] with little available food or water
	- The sandy terrain can shift and slide into new canyons without warning
	- Storms in the [[Barrens]] whip the desert up into terrifying walls of cutting chaotic sand.
	- As if the terrain and weather weren't bad enough, although [[The Glass Wars]] are over there are occasional [[Akari]] patrols
##  Peoples
- Common Races:
	-  once home of the [[Eeleerie]] although any of them with any sense are long gone
	- [[Tastora]] is the home of the longest standing population, composed of [[Secondhewn]] and [[Balulu]]
	- the healing city brings many visitors but among the most common are [[Starborn]] and [[Zharash]]
## Fauna
- Common Traits:
	- Any creature crazy enough to live here should be feared
	- Tough skin and great water retention
