Not much here in the central part of [[The Below]] except for the entrance/exit to [[The Mistbelt]] maybe an entrance to [[The Desolation]] if [[Akar, The Vast]] has made a connection with their burrowing.
3 rivers flow through the Central Caves, running from the [[The Brilliant North]] down into the [[Southern Crypts]]
Contains the  [[Deafening Deep]] on its northern end under the island of [[Akarus]] where [[Akar, The Vast]] lurks
