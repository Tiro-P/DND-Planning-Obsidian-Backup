Home of the [[T'keen]] and [[Euchari]] 
Maintained by the [[Greentails]] and [[Bluetails & Glowtails]] 
Where [[Kreladi]] is
This magnificent tree is like no other plant on this planet. 
Almost touching the sky this enormous tree was presented to [[Astarte]] along with the [[T'keen]] as a gift from [[Tataluk]]. The tree reaches down into the ocean drawing up and purifying water from it's roots, this water can't make it all the way up the tree so the leaves at the top of the tree also serve to bring in water, drinking in the clouds around them. The [[T'keen]] have lived in this tree for hundreds of years, carving houses and walkways into the hollow heart of the tree. The oldest of these walkways have been covered with new growths of bark making them look like they grew from the tree naturally. Along with walkways are so called “climbways” which are a series of branches or pegs that are evenly spaced around the tree for [[T'keen]] to use to swing from place to place, these are perhaps some of the least user-friendly paths to non [[T'keen]] possible.

This tree has been home to the T'keen for as long as they have existed and as such it has grown around their small constructions and healed from them cutting paths into it. The tree is treated with reverence by the [[Greentails]] who are in charge of the growth that expands the city within the mighty tree.
