## Terrain
- Description:
	- looking like floating mountains at sea the [[Ishull Beasts]] roam the ocean around [[Syncing/Atlas/Biomes/Clafikt|Clafikt]], [[Virullen]], [[Karegath]] and [[Eastern Atolls|The Eastern Atolls]]. From sea level they look like an island made of a reddish rock that gradually slope up into a small mountain complete with trees and other foliage. Below sea level their living nature can be seen, they have hundreds of long coils and tentacles that reach down into the depths of the ocean, clinging onto a volcanic vent that the beast feeds off of
- Challenges:
	- The [[Ishull Beasts]] are a challenge of their own, the 20ish beasts wonder around the ocean moving randomly from one undersea vent to the next. This can make them difficult to find. They also are constantly feeding and will grab and eat any swimmer that gets too friendly
	- The [[Ishull Beasts]] are frequented by pirates more than any other port cities so its always a good idea to keep one hand on your coin pouch.
	- The [[Ishull Beasts]] are capable of sinking fully below the water but do not unless they are sick, in great danger, or mating, these events are once in a century in terms of rarity
	- [[Veria]] can be found on some of the smaller beasts and are not to be underestimated.
