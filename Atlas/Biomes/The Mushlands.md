Home of the [[Anuke]]
Neighbors [[Ruins of Missios]] and the [[Gilded Steppes]]

Expansion? The  mushlands is having a great time growing into the wake of the [[Blightstorm]] and is the first thing someone traveling would see after passing through [[The Mistbelt]].  a stretch of wasteland and then tall fungal stalks off in the distance as the mushlands advances slowly. 
The mushlands have had zero success growing into the territory of [[Vaceron the Fair]] it could be that his power as an avatar keeps it at a distance.
