a massive shard of [[Heart Gems]] made by [[Tataluk]] in [[The Rolling Plains]], thought of as a pilgrimage site to the [[Balulu]] and now home of the city of [[Jelta]]

A massive Crystal shard towering over the plains, some [[Balulu]] elders will tell tails passed down for generations, of its appearance, A shard of the moon falling to the plains causing a dust cloud that blocked out the sky for days. Although respected by the [[Balulu]]  [[The Rolling Plains]] Shard has been colonized by the [[Jodin]] with their city of [[Jelta]] and is a large port of call for all many trade routes going through [[The Rolling Plains]].
