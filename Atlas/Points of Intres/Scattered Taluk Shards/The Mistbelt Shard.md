a massive shard of [[Heart Gems]] made by [[Tataluk]] in [[The Mistbelt]] very hard to see

Predating the existence of the [[Lunaris]] this massive shard of crystal is not anywhere close to common knowledge. It can sometimes be seen by travelers in [[Leafglen]] to the east and may be known to very few of the [[Wicks]], only those who are particularly adventurous or those who are able to feel its magic through the choking fog of [[The Mistbelt]].
