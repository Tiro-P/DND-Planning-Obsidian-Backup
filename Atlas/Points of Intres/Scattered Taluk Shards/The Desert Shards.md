thousands of shards of  [[Heart Gems]]  made by [[Tataluk]] in the [[Barrens]] now home to [[Tastora]] 
may appear in some [[Eeleerie]] myths 

In the middle of the desert a thousand shards of shining crystal rise from the sand, stand against the scorching desert sky. Rising from anywhere from 8-20ft tall these shards once were seen as forbidden and cursed territory by the [[Eeleerie]] of [[Ruins of Teerai|Teerai]] who's legends used to tell of them rising from the sand like fingers of some strange beast. But in the current time the desert shards are a welcome sight to weary travelers for they have been inhabited by the [[Secondhewn]] of [[Tastora]] and are a blessed oasis in the sands
