## Neighborhoods
- The Floating Shipyards
	- The floating shipyards are not as one would think floating in the sea, they are instead suspended by vines from the branches of [[The Hometree (biome)]] high up in the sky. The ships are built here because of the surplus of usable wood that is the Tree's many branches. The wood at the base of the tree is too dense and too thick to be of any use for ships so the branches are the obvious choice for T'keen shipmasters. When a boat is complete the shipmasters will cut the vines holding up the ship and it will fall all the way down into the ocean as a final test of its strength and quality. Some shipmasters will even ride the ships down, whether this is intentional or they are just caught unawares is not known.
- The Inner Tree
	- Paths and buildings have been carved out [[Greentails]] or grown by [[Bluetails & Glowtails|Glowtails]] all around the hollow center of the tree, the multiple seemingly haphazard layers are traversed easily by [[T'keen]] using “swingways” made up of pegs and poles sprouting from the tree. Visitors that are not capable of using the swingways can use some of the new paths that the [[Bluetails & Glowtails|Glowtails]] have been making or they will have to find a [[T'keen]] willing to pull them up with a rope. Large windows up to 30ft tall are created in knots found naturally in the trunk, the [[Greentails]] will cover them with hand woven nets to prevent pests from flying in. Often times [[T'keen]] will tie trinkets they found on their oceanic travels into the net as a gift for the tree because now that they know it cant move they feel sorry for it. The natural placement of the windows means that various areas of the Inner Tree can feel disconnected from the time outside if they don't have a window. In the nighttime many houses and stores still will light caged lanterns, making sure to always have water on hand. The [[Bluetails & Glowtails]] have been working on using [[Plantsinging]] to teach parts of the tree to glow when its dark but only high fire risk areas or large community areas have this feature.
- The Crown
	- Above the Floating Shipyards on the top of the branches is where the [[T'keen]] gardens are found, the leaves of [[The Hometree (biome)]] naturally draw in water from the clouds which is then carefully diverted to water crops. The crop beds are made by the [[T'keen]] out of mulch from the boat making process and are suspended by rope webs between the branches.
## Threads
- Many Pirates will visit Kreladi to get more crew or get their ship fixed
- The [[Nautilus]] is not based here but it does have a definite presence at the docks
