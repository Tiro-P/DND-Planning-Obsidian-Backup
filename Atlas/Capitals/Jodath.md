The city of Jodath was never intended to be a city, it started out as a small camp in the heart of [[The Brilliant North]] and slowly transformed into a mining town for [[Heart Gems]] and from there it grew and grew until it became the home of the [[Artifizer's Guild]] and the capital of the [[Jodin]]. Due to this unplanned expansion and the speed of the [[Jodin|Jodin’s]] technological advancement the city of Jodath is a confusing patchwork of new buildings on top of older ones.

- Age
	- Made in 100BB

## Neighborhoods
#### The Oceanic Sector
- The Oceanic Sector was once the newest and boldest project of the Artifizer's guild, a underwater city with airtight buildings and enclosed walkways. The city extension was a needed expansion as the general population of Jodath would complain about the larger artifizal contraptions and the destruction they cause when they are improperly powered. After several such occasions The Oceanic Sector was built to serve as a safe and regulation free testing ground for Artifizers. However the Sector was built a long time ago and its airtight buildings and enclosed walkways started to leak and several were lost to the ocean. After maintenance became tiresome the [[Artifizer's Guild]] commissioned Artifizal resonators that could hold back the water, this project took a long time to perfect but now the new Oceanic Sector is no longer a series of cramped and damp rooms. 18 main resonators hold back the ocean in a massive bubble above the lab buildings, with additional back up resonators to partition sections if repairs are needed. The Oceanic sector while once a shameful testing ground is now the pride of the [[Artifizer's Guild]] and where their most progressive Artifizer’s work. 
#### The Guild Library 
- The Guild Library is the shining gem of [[Artifizing]] provided you overlook all the real shining gems. Artfully carved into a massive column in the center of the cave the library is the oldest standing part of Jodath as it was saved from previous Artifizal disasters by the tireless guard of the Guild. This library is home to all of the collective knowledge of the [[Artifizer's Guild]] and is open only to those with the token of Guild membership. Artifizal knowledge is not the only knowledge in this library, it also holds thousands of trade records, detailed histories, natural and geological research, and much more. The library is very strict about entry but scholars outside of the guild can enter as long as they are carefully watched and have knowledge to trade. Part of the Guild Library is managed by [[Bellavier]] from the [[Bookkeepers]] they provide information from places much further away than most [[Jodin]] are willing to go. 

## Threads
- underground activities?
	- There’s word that in the fringes of the oceanic sector experiments were happening with using living [[Secondhewn]] in Artifizing there’s no proof but its thought that a previous resonator collapse was orchestrated to cover it up
- Defenses?
	- The brutal reputation of the [[Artifizer's Guild]] keeps most potential trouble makers away
	- after the [[Shadowdwellers]] kidnapped some [[Jodin]] and the [[Firsthewn]] and [[Secondhewn]] had to step in to rescue them Jodath has always kept a strong guard incase the [[Shadowdwellers]] ever find a way around the [[Mountain Beasts|Mountain Beast]] blocking their way
