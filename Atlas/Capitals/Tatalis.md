The first and only city built by the [[Firsthewn|Firsthewn Taluk]], the elegant spires of Tatalis twist upwards their opalescent tinted blue mixing with the pure blue of the sky, a shining series of towers woven out of opalescent [[Heart Gems]], the same gems that the [[Firsthewn]] themselves were originally shaped from. The city was sung into being over many years by all of the [[Firsthewn]] working as one in the Council Chamber

-  The Council Chamber
	- The council chamber is shaped in a circle with a thin geometrically faceted roof and a circle of bleacher like seats around the entire circumference of the room. The discussions in this chamber are conducted through the Resonance, the song of the [[Firsthewn]] warping the chamber around them in dazzling patterns until a decision is reached as a whole and the room is solidified to reflect this new shape in their order.
