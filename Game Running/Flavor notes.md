# General Goals
## Making it fun
- Attack player and character strengths! both in and out of combat, Attacking weaknesses is a good way to make the party grow but if they made their character to be a terrific thief let them do an epic heist or if they want to be a great duelist then let them duel. its fun to be challenged but its also really fun to be good at things
- use [[Encounter Variance]] or [[Environments & Travel]]
- **"I know a guy" Tokens** at the start of a campaign or in certain locations based on character backstory give players a physical token (can be a letter or favor coin, hasty i.o.u ect.), each of these physical tokens will allow the player to hand over the token and say "I know a guy" and create an NPC that can help the party with the current problem. They would have to include the name of the NPC,  how this character knows them and how they could maybe help this problem
> [!info] Example of using an I know a guy
> - The party is having trouble sneaking past a guarded gate into a castle, so they give you a token and say I know a guy, his name is Aleo Grenta I went to school with him way back when, He owns a bakery that sells bread to the castle, and he could help sneak us in.
> - This is a powerful tool for the party and it is balanced by the fact that they have to use their backstory and put thought into a way they would help. its also balanced by the limited amount you give and that they have to be able to contact them.
### Information delivery
- Have information be delivered in different ways such as word of mouth, encoded notes, letters, spying. what ever way you want so that it is a team effort and everyone who tries could find knowledge in *their* way
	- Getting letters to the players
		- Courier
		- Stabbed to something (they get a knife)
		- Burned building
		- Desk drawer
		- Someone's pockets
	- Making letters unique
		- Perfume it
		- Wax seals
		- paper quality (high or low)
		- font
		- Vocabulary used
## Keeping Impact and cohesion
- use [[Loot, Boons & Burdens]] to keep things fresh, players should be excited for more than just their next level up they have planned, surprise them a little by stretching their character a little
- Make sure you pay attention to the wants and moods of the party and [[How to keep a feel of progression|Keep a feel of progression]]. wallowing around in no progress wont make it feel better when it happens it will just make them wonder why it took so long
- Party Unity ([source](https://youtu.be/dbPR3CgL70s?si=19Pt6DyzYT4c9Dev))
	- unity of purpose They should all want to do the same thing, methods and reasons can varrie
		- have a big bad do something wrong to each of them
		- larger event that puts pressure on them
		- they should each have their own adventure within it
	- unity of history
		- This kicks in later in the campaign as the group will help each other simply because they know each other 
## Keeping Scale
- the [[Nirnaeth]] flying ships should be rare outside of travel to [[Arminaleth]] 
- artifizery caravans don't go fast they just move at walking speed and can carry more
- most of the large biomes in the world will contain smaller biomes that are variations on the main biome
## Making it interesting
- Flavor magic strongly 
	- consider how the magic changes the user and how the user can change the magic 
	- Combine the magics and have them flow from one to the other like:
		- A plant that heals during the day but under the light of [[Kesk|Kesk's]] red moon it becomes a poison
# Genre Specific Flavoring
## Horror

Over describe things
Under describe things
Fingers, teeth, and eyes
Short sentences in rapid succession build tension Single sentence paragraphs build dread
Uncanny valley=things that aren't normal almost getting it right 
Third person limited view
Limited explanations
Rot, mold, damage, age, static, flickering, especially in places it shouldn't be 
Limited sights for your mc -blindness, darkness, fog, refuse 
Real consequences 
Being alone -the more people there are, the less scary it is 
Intimate knowledge, but only on one side
