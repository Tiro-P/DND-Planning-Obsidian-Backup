# Class Specific
## Bard
### Lingering Performance 
*Prerequisite: bardic performance class ability*
The bonuses and penalties from your bardic performance continue for 2 rounds after you cease performing. Any other requirement, such as range or specific conditions, must still be met for the effect to continue. If you begin a new bardic performance during this time, the effects of the previous performance immediately cease
[source](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/lingering-performance/)
### Spellsong
*Prerequisites: Cha 13, bardic performance class ability, able to cast 1st-level spells*
You can combine your bardic performance and your spellcasting in two ways. 
- First, you can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. 
	- As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with a Perform check. Observers must make a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of your bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell’s casting time.
- Second, as a move action, you can use 1 round of bardic performance to maintain a bard spell with a duration of concentration. 
	- You can cast another spell in the same round you are using bardic magic to maintain concentration; if you do this, your concentration on the maintained spell ends when you end the bardic performance the spell is part of.
