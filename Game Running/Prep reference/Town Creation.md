When defining a town that the party will be in for an extended amount of time consider the GUARDS method
**G**overnment buildings
**U**nderworld activities
**A**ltars
**R**esources
**D**efences
**S**ocial Hubs
You don't have to add all of these right off the bat or at all for some towns. But having some of them and some thoughts on how the parts interact, will allow you to add depth later if you want to.

you can also if you want a map, make a city or neighborhood using [one of these](https://watabou.itch.io/) Specifically the City or neighborhood generator 

If you want a massive populated city for some reason you could use [this generator](https://praxxian.github.io/RPG-City-Generator/) but honestly its a bit much, especially in a homebrew world
