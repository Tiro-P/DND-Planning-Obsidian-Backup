## Enemies
- Use commander figures within the enemies to give direction. make sure they make the enemy stronger when they are there, and weaker when they aren't
```ad-hint
title: Examples
Benifits when they are there: Get reinforcements, Push towards their goal, Inspiration, More team work, 
Disadvantages when they are killed: Disorganization, fear effects, Fleeing, Less coordination, Vengence.

```
## Locales
- lots of terrain utilization, Emphasize mobility in combat *moving should be a risk reward consideration not just get closer to smack, or not move and chuck spells*
- Heavily interactable area (flip tables for cover, chuck chairs at them, use the chandelier, ect.) *make sure the enemies use it, to show its doable*
- Chaos does not know a main character, involve more than just the characters. *to make a feeling of chaos effect the world around the fight, environment, NPCs*
- Difficulty doesn't have to just come from the enemy it can also come from the environment this can also help balance action economy
```ad-hint
title: Examples
Crumbling cave with falling stalagtites, a cold enviroment where they have to stay near warmth or freeze, a cursed location with saves associated, fighting up hill, dungeon style traps, areas that provide magical buffs or vice versa. sandstorm that effects visability, sound sensitive enviroment, roaving beast that will eat the closest thing every round, ect

```
## Mechanics
- 1 free skill check a turn (for monsters too)
- Any "weapon" does at least 1d4 +str/dex *also applies to locales because you need to make the environment interactable*
- Max damage on crits (no rolls) makes combat more lethal (another step away from confirming crits)
- injuries on crits or downs; bleed, movement, str, ect that linger until the next long rest ([15:50](https://youtu.be/fGMtPEzhQfo?si=bYd2ioxbJUorVMc8&t=950)) (have a con save or a %chance from the enemies to do this) 
 ```ad-hint
title: Examples
These should be minor injuries, each one should be a bit of the whole pie just an annoyance
Speed down from being hamstrung, Max health down from getting concussed, Bleeding 2hp per round so they need to be cared for immediatly post combat, -2 to hit ranged because a hit on the arm. Crushed arm so you have dissadvantage on Str.
**REMEMBER KEEP EACH ONE MILD THEY WILL BUILD**
```
- Increase the rareness of health potions or change the potency of them. *This lets you have impactful hits that aren't killing blows, or K.Os which are either a very big thing or a boring fight for the K.Od player*
### Utilizing Action Economy
- Avoid the party being able to focus fire
	- Consider burrowing, flanking, invisibility, and using alternate combat objectives
- Make the party focus fire, 
	- you could have a big threat such as a wizard charging up a spell
	- or a mechanically active threat that draws aggro intentionally, by using grapple or  pushing and pulling people around. 
	- If the Captain or leader dies the rest of the enemies can just flee
- Make sure the players have choices they have to make in combat, not just attack the nearest target until it dies
- Let monsters have objectives other than simply attacking the characters so there are consequences to leaving them alone or ways to distract them
- Use NPC hostages they have to rescue or have to fight around
- use the environment to your aid
	- Legendary actions, lair actions, 
	- environmental effects, traps
## Stacking Encounters
In a highly dangerous area combats should not be balanced individually, consider using smaller battles before the large one to whittle away at the players health and abilities, this also gives you more info to balance the final fight as you know what the players have used up to that point.
