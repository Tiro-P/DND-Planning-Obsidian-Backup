*Likeable*, *interesting*, *nuanced*, *developed* is the goal

If people are self taught have them do things in unorthodox ways that would either horrify or impress a traditionally trained person

You can have powerful NPCs but they are always a tool for you before a boon for them. That doesn't mean make all powerful NPC's evil but it does mean you can kill, kidnap, corrupt or much more to them to get the players more involved or have them make or find more problems
