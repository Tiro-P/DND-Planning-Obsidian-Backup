## Saving Throw DCs
the DC for a saving throw against a spell is 10 + spell level + casting modifier

## Conterspells
must be done as a readied action, when the targeted enemy starts to cast a spell,
	1. you then make a spellcraft check (DC 15+spell level) as a free action
	2. if you succeed the spellcraft check you identify the spell and can attempt to counter it
	3. to complete the counterspell you may cast spell identical to the one they were going to cast as a counterspell, 
	4. provided the target is in range the two spells negate each other 
- Metamagic is not taken into account when determining whether it can be countered or not
- you can sometimes use opposing spells as a counterspell 
- you can also sometimes use dispel magic to counterspell without needing to identify the spell 
	- this requires a dispel check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11+ casting level of the person you are countering
