# Basics
- Does not decrees the scores but applies a penalty to the skills and stats based on the ability
- for every 2 points of damage to a single ability apply a -1 penalty to skills and statistics based on that ability, 
- if you take ability damage equal to or greater than you are unconscious until the damage is less than the ability score *unless* its constitution, then you die
- Unless otherwise noted ability score damage is healed at the rate of 1 per day to each ability score that was damaged, they  can also be healed through spells like restoration
- **Ability Score Penalties** function the same but usually last shorter, and cannot decrease the score to anything below 1
- **Ability Drain** actually reduces the relevant ability score, this can impact skill ranks (int) hit points (con) and other bonuses. it will not heal over time but can be healed with magic
