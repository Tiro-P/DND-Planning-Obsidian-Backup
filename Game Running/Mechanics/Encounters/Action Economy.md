Combat is still within the roleplay have characters describe what they do and then you respond to that. make sure people think about how their character would fight.
# Damage
- if penalties reduce damage to less than 1 it still deals 1 point of non lethal damage
- Melee/Thrown (Str mod)
	- when using an off hand weapon you add only half of your strength bonus, if you have a strength penalty the entire penalty applies
	- When dealing damage with a twohanded weapon you add your strength bonus x1.5 you don't get the extra half if you are using a light weapon twohanded
- Ranged weapons (Dex)
	- Str penalties but not bonuses apply on damage rolls with non composite bows
# Initiative
- **Flat footed**, in the beginning of combat before you have acted you are flat footed, you do not get your dex bonus to ac and are unable to make attacks of opportunity
- **Surprise** When some combatants are unaware of all the opponents a surprise round happens before the regular rounds begin. In initiative order the combatants that are aware can take a Standard *or* Move action, as well as free actions 
- Initiative is typically solid through combat except for the use of [[Action Economy#Special Initiative Actions|Special Initiative Actions]] 
# Actions

## Five foot Step
you can make a 5 foot step in a round where you haven’t made any other kind of movement
- it never provokes an AoO
- you can only take a 5ft step if your movement isn’t hampered by difficult terrain or darkness
- any creature with a move speed of 5ft or less its just a normal move action
- you cant take a 5 foot step using a form of movement you don't have a listed speed for
## Attacks of Opportunity
An attack of opportunity is taken when an enemy in your threatened area^[you must be armed to threaten an area] either moves out of your threatened area or does a [distracting action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/Combat/#Table-Actions-in-Combat) that would divert their attention from you
- **Making an Attack of Opportunity** an AoO is a single melee attack, most players can only do one per round unless they have [Combat reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat) 
	- you dont have to make an AoO if you dont want to
	- you make it at your normal attack bonus
	- AoO's should be resolved the moment they are provoked then go back to the flow of combat
	- **Noteable things that dont provoke AoOs Include**:
		- 

### Withdraw
withdrawing from melee combat is a *full round action* that lets you move out of a threatened space without causing an AoO and up to double your movement. If you move through other threatened squares during this action it will still provoke an AoO as normal

## Free Actions
Free actions take no time and rarely provoke AoOs
- Cease Concentration on a Spell
- Drop an item into your space or an adjacent one
- Drop [[Conditions|Prone]] in your space
- Speak, anything beyond a few sentences is usually more than a standard free action, can be done out of turn in certain circumstances
## Swift actions
Swift actions take very little time but require more effort than a free action, you can do one per turn without effecting your other actions, They usually involve spellcasting, using feats, or magic items
- Casting quickened spells or any spells that say they are a swift action. casting a spell like this will not provoke an AoO
## Immediate Actions
Immediate Actions are very similar to swift actions, but they can be performed at any time, even out of turn
- You are limited to one per round
- using an Immediate action on your turn counts as your Swift action
- you cannot use an immediate action while flat footed

## Standard Actions
### Attacks
- **Melee Attacks**  
	- Unarmed melee attacks will provoke an AoO from the enemy you attack^[This does not apply for "armed unarmed attacks" such as with monk weapons]
- **Ranged Attacks**
	- Thrown attacks usually have a max range of 25 ft.
	- Projectile weapons usually have a max range of 50 ft.
	- If you make a ranged attack on a target engaged in melee with an ally you take a -4 to the attack roll unless they are at least 10 ft away (in cases such as reach weapons)
		- if the target is two sizes larger than your ally the penalty is reduced to -2
		- there is no penalty for using a ranged attack at an enemy 3 or more sizes larger than your ally
		- This penalty can be removed with the [Precise shot feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/precise-shot-combat)
- **Natural attacks**
	- Natural attacks are done using your full attack bonus and receive your Str mod
	- if you have only one natural attack such as a bite you add Str bonus x 1.5 to its damage
	- *Secondary natural attacks* these include thing such as tails and wings, attacks using these are done with BAB -5 and you only add half the Str mod to damage
	- When using Natural attacks in conjunction with melee or unarmed attacks, you can use them as long as the limb they are tied to has not been used, this also makes them function as *Secondary natural attacks* for purposes of attack and damage rolls, [Two weapon fighting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat) (PCs) and [Multiattack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/multiattack-combat) (Monster) can reduce these penalties making it only a -2 to hit

		- you can touch one ally as a standard action or up to six as a full round action
		- using the free action touch attack does count as an armed attack so wont provoke AoO from the target
		- while holding the charged spell you can attack with unarmed or a natural weapon (provoking an AoO) and if it hits it deals normal damage and the spell is discharged, if the attack misses you are still holding the charge
		- if you don't discharge the spell, either by choice or by missing the attack/touch roll in the round it was cast you can hold it indefinitely
