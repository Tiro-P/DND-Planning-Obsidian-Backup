# Combat Maneuver Cheat Sheet
## Bull Rush

A bull rush can be used as a standard action or as part of a charge on a target no larger than one size above you. This maneuver will cause an attack of opportunity for the target of the maneuver. If you succeed in the maneuver it moves the target back 5ft, with an additional 5ft for every 5 you exceed their CMD. If you fail the roll your movement ends in front of the target

Creatures moved by a bull rush do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

You cannot Bull rush a target into a square with a solid object.

If you Bull rush a target into a space with another opponent you must make a check against them too.

## Dirty Trick

Dirty trick covers any attack that seeks to disable the opponent in any way, such as kicking sand into their eyes to blind them, or punching them in the stomach to make them sickened. This maneuver must be done in melee range as a standard action and allows the target to perform an opportunity of attack. Any negative of this attack can be removed if the target spends their move action to recover. Otherwise this ability lasts for one round plus another round for every 5 you exceeded their CMD by.

If your attack is successful, the target takes a penalty. The penalty is limited to one of the following conditions:

[blinded](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded), [dazzled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dazzled), [deafened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened), [entangled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled), [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken), or [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened).

## Disarm

You can attempt to disarm a foe in place of a melee attack, this will give them an opportunity attack. Doing this while unarmed gives you a -4. When you succeed they drop one item of your choice, if you succeed 10 over their CMD they drop both items they are holding. If you fail by 10 or more you drop your weapon. And finally if you do this maneuver unarmed you automatically pick up the item.

## Drag

You can attempt to drag a foe as a standard action. You cannot drag a foe more than one size category larger than you. This Maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity. 

If you are successful you drag the opponent in a straight line behind you 5 ft back with your opponent occupying your original space and you occupying the one behind it. For every 5 you exceed their CMD you can drag them another 5ft up to a max of however much movement you have on the given turn. 

The opponent being dragged will not provoke an attack of opportunity and cannot be dragged through occupied tiles.

Any traits that grant a bonus against Bull Rush attempts grant a bonus against Drag as well.

## Overrun (kinda bad ngl)

As a standard action, taken as part of a charge or during your movement you can attempt to run through their square without attacking. This does provoke an attack of opportunity. If you fail you are stopped directly in front of the target.

When you decide to do this the target can choose to avoid you, allowing you to pass through without requiring an attack . if it doesn't you make a check as normal. If you succeed you move through the space unhindered, if you succeed by 5 or more the target is knocked prone. 

For every additional leg the target has they get +2 DC

  

## Reposition

You can attempt to reposition a foe to a different location as a standard action. You can only do this to opponents one size category above you or smaller. Attempting to reposition a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target. If you succeed you may move the target 5ft. With an extra 5ft for every 5 your attack exceeds their CMD. at all times they need to be within your reach except for the final 5 which can be a space adjacent to your reach. You cannot use this to put them into an intrinsically dangerous area such as off of a cliff.

## Steal

You can attempt to take an item from a foe as a standard action. This maneuver can be used in melee to take any item that is neither held nor hidden in a bag or pack. You need to have a free hand for this maneuver and must select the item before the check is made. Items that are loosely attached are the easiest to take, items fastened to the foe like a pouch or sheathed weapon get a +5 to CMD and items worn closely are impossible to steal. Items held by the foe cannot be stolen with this maneuver, instead use disarm. Attempting to steal will give the target an opportunity of attack. The target is instantly aware of what you have taken.

You can use a whip to do this at range with a -4 to the roll.

  

## Sunder

You can sunder an item held or worn by a foe in place of a melee attack, this does provoke an attack of opportunity. If your attack is successful you deal damage to the item. If it is reduced to half its total hp it is broken if it is reduced to 0 you can choose to destroy it or leave it with 1hp and the broken condition.

  

## Trip

You can attempt to trip your opponent in place of a melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. This provokes an attack of opportunity for the target. If your attack succeeds the target is knocked prone, if you fail by more than 10 you are knocked prone instead. Creatures with no legs or flying creatures cannot be tripped. Creatures with additional legs get a +2 to the DC for each extra leg they have. 

When using a weapon with the trip feature, if you fail by 10 you can choose to drop the weapon rather than fall prone.
