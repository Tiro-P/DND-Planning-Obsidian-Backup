# Loot 
Reward with power, reputation, knowledge, and then gold in that order. Its better to have something that would be bought be instead, gifted, or have it made special for them or made by them as giving it a bit of story will make it mean more. 
- **Information** 
	- (relating to any of the [[3 Arc Structure|Story Arcs]])  
	- [[Flavor notes#Information delivery|Information Delivery]]
- **Reputation**
	- Guilds, more info or utilities
	- Merchants, discounts
	- Titles
- **Useable items**. 
	- *Flavor*
		- Sleeves of many garments
	- *Permanent*
		- Access to new areas or transport methods
		- Magical items or [Relics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/relics/)
	- *Consumable*
		- "charm of opening" that can open locks
		- [Magical Materials for casting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/variant-magic-rules/esoteric-material-components/)
	- Its important to know that with magical items you give, if they don't have an expiry date or limited uses, will effect your balance for the rest of the campaign. With that in mind sometimes, it is better to have consumable rewards, or, when you do give a powerful magical reward have an idea of how long they will have it and if they will ever have to get rid of it. Maybe **Curse** it, the more specific the use the more rewarding it will be to use it
- **Monetary rewards** (Gold, jewels ect.)
	- Players should have opportunities to spend money above what they earn so it matters
	- Travel or events are expensive
	- Charity can be a money sink such as monetarily helping a town recover from a raid
	- Being visibly rich can bring about [[Bounty Hunters]]
	- Monetary rewards can also be made more special by making it a good that they have to find a buyer for, such as a piece of the monster or an artifact. then they have to barter. Think of reselling items as an opportunity for a puzzle

*When you give them a particularly exciting reward give them a physical card about it! especially if you are worried they will forget about it*
# Boons & Burdens
## ## Everybody
### Boons
- Level up
- Backstory tie-ins
- Stat ups
-  [Traits](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/)
- A pet
### Burdens
- Kill a NPC (liked or helpful) (just don't do this too often)
- An [affliction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/)
- Enemies from a previous arc come back or get stronger cause they messed up
- A cursed object with attached side quest
- Fixing what they've done
### Middle ground
- [Conditional favor](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Conditional%20Favor) effected spell that effects the group
## Magic users:
### Boons
- [Custom flavored spell books](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spellbooks/), The preparation rituals in these books are pretty cool for unique flavor
- [Metamagic rods](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/rods/metamagic-rods/) can be a good yet slightly boring reward if the character has spells they haven't been using for reasons or want more power, definitely consider making them damaged or weaker than written so they have to think about using them rather than just all the time.

### Burdens
- a [Spellblight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/variant-magic-rules/spellblights)
- Damaged spell book
- Corruption that disconnects them in some way from divine magic
- A concussion for a bit
## Physics users (Ranged & Melee):
### Boons
- Weapon materials (can come in the form of unusable weapons or trophies)
- Physical mutation
-  magical shield/armor (not always big named armor think of the area they get it and a specific use case)
- A special and limited ammo
- New skill learned from the combat

### Burdens
- Damage or break their armor or weapons, it may hurt at the time but its fixable and can lend more flavor
- Physical injury, this can be pretty easy to get rid of with healing magic but could leave phantom pains or the like, could be tied to skill check disadvantages

## Modifications
Modifications can be made to Boons or burdens to fine tune their balance
### Boons
- Damaged or worn
	- Makes the item unreliable or worse for its intended purpose, sometimes a certain amount of use will break it
- Esoteric
	- Takes set time and effort to decode or to learn how to use, think an encrypted spell book or a particularly difficult weapon
- Unpredictable
	- pretty self explainatory, can either be done with a table or a smaller set of options (50/50)
- Bound
	- This isnt yours and it should be, it will probably cause you some trouble in the future
- Contaminated/Mixed magic
	- This artifact has plenty of room to store magic but its not all of one kind. the effects of this might change based on time or location due to the mix of magical energy inside of it
		- Example: Amulet, while this is on a character it seems to channel empathy magic, increasing the healing ability and diplomacy of this character, but it contains a bit of the taluk's resonance so when they try to use it sometimes it will have sonic effects 
		- This is a bit of a harder one to make on the fly but the complexity in flavor is nearly unmatched, you can also use it to provide a fixable choose your own path item where they can pick which magic they want to keep, or maybe find a way to weave them together so it works better all around,
### Burdens
- Conditional
	- Works worse in certain situations, like a curse only getting bad when near [[Ichor]] 
- Silver lining
	- that curse you got made you go to the church and now they are helping you in your quest
	- turns out it makes you blend in better with the bad guys
