Environments, for each biome have some common elemental or damage or magic resistances that creatures that live there would get like cold resistance in cold places or like the animals of the Blue woods being more sensitive to blugeoning damage

When describing how to get somewhere use landmarks that are within 2 days travel and explain how to get from one to the next rather than saying its a 800 mile trip or something boring like that. 

Keep mystery, people shouldnâ€™t really ever feel completely safe while traveling.
# Travel Speeds
- ### Walking 
	- 24 Miles per day ( Player speed / 10 ) x (Time Traveled)
	- 3 mph ( Player speed / 10 )
	- 30ft move speed
	- stops to eat and drink 
	- typically only 8 hours of travel for sustained travel
- ### Mounted 
	- 40-48 Miles per day
	- 5-6 mph
	- 50-60 ft move speed
	- typically only 8 hours of travel for sustained travel
	- needs feed for the steed
- ### Artifizing Caravan
	- 48 Miles per day
	- 4 mph
	- 40 ft move speed
	- much fewer stops than walking
	- typically 12 hours of travel a day
	- not good at rough terrain
	- not common to the east of [[The Mistbelt]]
	- uses large [[Heart Gems]] (roughly the size of 3-4 basket balls) that should be changed every 2 days and will break after 3 days of regular use 
		- needs extra gems or a [[Crystal Golems#Charge Golems|Charge Golem]] for travel longer than 2 days
- ### Nirnaeth Boats
	- 216 Miles per day
	- 9 mph
	- 90 ft move speed
	- no stops
	- Can fly 24 hours a day
	- can fly but is only used for [[Nirnaeth]] trade and diplomatic missions to or from [[Arminaleth]]
- ### [[T'keen]] Boats
	- 360 Miles per day at top speed 
	- 15 mph
	- 150 ft move speed
	- only stops at ports if selling items, or for supplies
		- its very expensive to get a ship that wont need to stop at ports 
	- can sail 24 hours a day with adequate crew^[30 non-[[T'keen]] or 12 [[T'keen]], unless in a full crew of [[T'keen]] one [[T'keen]] does the work of 2 non-[[T'keen]]]
		- If the crew is running slim it can only do 16 hours a day as the crews sleep rotations overlap (240 Miles per day)
	- limited to the oceans, mostly the southern ones as the north have [[Akari]]
