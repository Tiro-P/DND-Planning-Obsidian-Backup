## About Potations
- Potions; skillful concoctions created by alchemists out of natural ingredients to do reliable and repeatable effects similar to magic spells
	- Potions most commonly are consumed for healing or enhancing stats
- Potations; concoctions made by magic users using magic ingredients in *hope* of producing a useful effect
	- Potations are much more wild in effect based on the school of magic fed into them and the material used
	- They can be thrown or drank, and whether or not the potation is contained changes its effects




## Creating a Potation

- Casters with the Craft potion skill can make potions
- Requires a vessel for brewing
- They burn a spell slot of their choosing to pour that magic into magic accepting ingredients and make the corresponding Craft check
- Basic crafting DCs and costs are similar to those found within the [[alt skill and crafting rules]]
- After the materials have been infused, they will need to "brew"  for a time depending on the effect and then you have a potation!
