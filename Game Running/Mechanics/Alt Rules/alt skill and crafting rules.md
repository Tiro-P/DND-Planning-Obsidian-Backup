# Alt Crafting Rules
Source: [d20pfsrd](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/alternate-crafting-rules)
These alternate crafting rules are made to simplify the process of using the Craft skill, and mitigate the way it slows down the game pacing
- Situational Bonuses and Penalties
	- You need a suitable area and tools or you take a -2 penalty
	- Masterwork tools grant a +2 circumstance bonus
	- Crafting a masterwork item *or* item with a special material increases difficulty by one step
	- Crafting a masterwork item *with* a special material increases difficulty by two steps
- Materials and Costs
	- *Crafting* an item can be done with materials at least 1/4 of the value of the final product
	- *Repairing* an item can be done for 1/10th the items cost in raw materials and has the same DC as crating the item
- Crafting
	- you can attempt a craft check once a day and progress according to the table, 
	- if you exceed by 5 it doubles, 10 it triples, 15 quadruples, ect. 
	- If you fail there is no progress, if you fail by 5 or more you loose material equal to the base progress up to a max of the cost of the materials
		- Wasted material has to be replenished before you can continue crafting
	- when the total progress equals the cost of the item (**not the cost of the materials**)it is complete
- Special crafting
	- Crafting a masterwork item or item with a special material increases difficulty by one step
	- Crafting a masterwork item out of a special material increases difficulty by two steps

# Background Skills
Source:[d20pfsrd](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/background-skills)
Background skills is a optional skill system that divides skills into adventuring skills and background skills
- Adventuring skills are progressed as normal with skill ranks
- Background skills can be progressed with normal skill ranks, or background specific skill ranks, of which you get 2 upon every level up
This division is so that skills that provide minimal help in day to day adventuring don't feel like wasting ranks
*This part is a little extra not really too needed unless someone wants one of these skills*
Along with the split between background and adventuring skills there are two new skills somewhat akin to Craft, Profession and Perform, called Artistry and Lore
- Examples of Artistry include: choreography, criticism, literature (including poetry), musical composition, philosophy, and playwriting
- Lore represents a players specific niche of interest that has to be smaller than a knowledge skill Examples include: Knowledge of famous painters, Balulu brewing techniques, History of a specific area or people, a specific monster (not "dragon" think more like "green dragon")
