If the party does a viewed crime smack a bounty on them, based on how bad the act, the higher the bounty, the stronger the bounty hunters. 

The hallmarks of a good bounty hunter are  Conviction, Observation, and Patience

Consider giving them stealth and a note book full of your players weaknesses they learned from watching the party

Use lures and pay off NPCs to sabotage them

Really exploit if they don't keep night watch and steal their stuff


possible types of bounty hunters:
- Minor party
- Brute
- Beast master
 - Trapper
