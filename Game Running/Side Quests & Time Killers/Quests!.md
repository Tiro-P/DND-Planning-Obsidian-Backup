Quests don't have to be done but are an opportunity for the characters to get more rewards by deviating from the main quest
Quests also show that although the main quest is the party's biggest concern, the world still goes on. keep it feeling lively
### Types
- Kill
	- one big bad (crime lord, cult leader, vigilante?)
	- hoard/cult (poachers, bandits, cult, small town?)
- Delivery
	- protect and deliver (Jodin stuff, supply of magic, any good, people, criminals?)
- Escort
	- fetch or delivery (This is just Delivery but with a pal, who may be attacked or may attack)
- Collection quest
	- go get a bunch of one thing (potion ingredients, Legal documents, mostly adventure/talking)
	- extended fetch, kill or deliver quest ( Bring back the pelts of 20 goblins, mostly attrition for a reason)
- investigation quest
	- start with one or two leads build off improv? ( missing person, local cryptid)
- defense quest
	- prepare (help the town prep for bandit raid, or monster)
- combo!
	- mostly there for the d8
	- combine 2 quest type

### ways to get quest
- Quest/bounty board
	- put up by different organizations 
	- if a less official location it could also have postings from town NPCs, (always a good idea to include some really mundane sounding ones)
- NPC
	- approaches the party themselves because they look strong 
	- NPC could be an emissary of a powerful creature / organization they would want the be on the good side of (could give a I know a guy token)
- Optional parts of the main quest
	- acquire allies or a relic that would help ( opportunity gathered from notes or happenstance npc)
	- save mildly important NPC (didnt talk to someone for a while, or messed up somehow)
	- sabotage the antagonist from doing something larger (opportunity from gathered info)
- omens or Legends
	- could be real could be not ( can hear about the in a tavern or from a fortune teller or the like)
	- Can be tied to NPCs having visions

### Considerations
- how long will it take, from a few in game hours to a few in game days, how long irl
- how hard is it gonna be? Risk of death? How many slip ups are allowed
- where does it start, where will it take them
- what's the reward, this is probably the only reason they'll do it. Make sure it's flavored appropriately based on the quest giver.
