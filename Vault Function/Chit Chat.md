# Q
- [ ] Government? What kinds are there and are they now specific to race or does each populated city keep its own government (Alaris)
	- [ ] And on the subject how would it work in Illureth, have the Cha’rell included Myelos in their government? Was there segregation at any point?
	- [ ] Are the organizations we made during world building the main, biggest factions in our world or are they just specialized enough that they warrant consideration? Do have any governing capacity?

	- [ ] Response
- [ ] We should probably establish a list of wars/disputes between races, the only two I can think of is [[The Glass Wars]] and what happened between the  [[Shadowdwellers]], [[Jodin]] and [[Firsthewn]]. also *maybe* the destruction of [[Ruins of Krov|Krov]]. But I'm sure there are advancements or purification/corruptions that can be reasoned as disputes.
	- [ ] 
- [ ] What would [[Astarte]] think about the [[Jodin]] as they live underground and kinda away from the sky? would this effect their ability to use [[Ethum]] or something?
- [ ] Any race can get to [[The Skybrand]] right? if they do the heroic stuff or do [[Astarte|Astarte’s]] riddles 3 or whatever the challenge is
