- [ ] We should probably establish a list of wars/disputes between races, the only two I can think of is [[The Glass Wars]] and what happened between the  [[Shadowdwellers]], [[Jodin]] and [[Firsthewn]]. also *maybe* the destruction of [[Ruins of Krov|Krov]]. But I'm sure there are advancements or purification/corruptions that can be reasoned as disputes.
