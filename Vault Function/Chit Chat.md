# Q
- [ ] Government? What kinds are there and are they now specific to race or does each populated city keep its own government (Alaris)
	- [ ] And on the subject how would it work in Illureth, have the Cha’rell included Myelos in their government? Was there segregation at any point?
		- I talked to Trent about this a little, the Myelos 
	- [ ] Are the organizations we made during world building the main, biggest factions in our world or are they just specialized enough that they warrant consideration? Do have any governing capacity?
		- I think people just made organizations they thought would be cool or particularly noteworthy. I think there would definitely be governments that weren’t made during worldbuilding.-Tiro 
- [ ] Names of regions
	- [ ] What are the names of the major islands? does the main continent have just one name or is it mostly referred to by its [[Biomes]]?
		- names of the islands are listed on the world map with their biome marker -Tiro
		- since there is just one continent and its divided up among people I think it would be referred to by either the people living there ([[Mippieps|Mippiep]] Territory, ect.) or the [[Biome]] depending on who was talking about it and why -Tiro

- [ ] The starborn are like  5 times purified which is a massive amount how is that reflected in them today (other than just the [[Blighted]] being cast out)
	- [ ] what is purification -Q 
		- [ ] that’s kinda the question I’m asking, game wise its pushing them to an alignment but my question was what’s that mean for the starborn specifically because they are an extreme example -Tiro
- [ ] We should probably establish a list of wars/disputes between races, the only two I can think of is [[The Glass Wars]] and what happened between the  [[Shadowdwellers]], [[Jodin]] and [[Firsthewn]]. also *maybe* the destruction of [[Ruins of Krov|Krov]]. But I'm sure there are advancements or purification/corruptions that can be reasoned as disputes.
	- [ ] I was thinking that for the most part, races were isolated to their own lands, save for the inhabitants of 
- [ ] What would [[Astarte]] think about the [[Jodin]] as they live underground and kinda away from the sky? would this effect their ability to use [[Ethum]] or something?
- [ ] Any race can get to [[The Skybrand]] right? if they do the heroic stuff or do [[Astarte|Astarte’s]] riddles 3 or whatever the challenge is
- [ ] How long is [[Rewriting]] and are the moons still out during it
