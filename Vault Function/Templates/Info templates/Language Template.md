		- Every morpheme is a free morpheme

		- Combine one or more morphemes into a word. Each morpheme remains distinct
	- Fusional language
		- Similar to Agglutinative language but the combined morphemes do not remain distinct this language uses inflectional morphology
	- Polysynthetic language,
		- High morpheme to word ratio, combine a large number of morphemes to sentence sized words
### Bound Morphemes
- These use a mix of Suffixes, Prefixes, Infixes, and Interweaving
