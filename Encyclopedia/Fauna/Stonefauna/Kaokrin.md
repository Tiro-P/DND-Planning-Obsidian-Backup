natural birds composed of crystal, often found in [[The Brilliant North]] and [[Central caves]], a variant entirely composed of [[Heart Gems]] can be found in both [[The Bluewoods]] as well as [[The Heartlands]] proper
These dazzling birds come in all shapes and sizes, these birds do not have a typical bird song, instead they will peck parts of their chest to make soft chiming noises. These cheerful creatures are sometimes kept as pets or in stored in cages to be used for [[Artifizing]].
Its not clear how these birds reproduce but research into their relation to [[Crystal Golems]] has never come back conclusively
