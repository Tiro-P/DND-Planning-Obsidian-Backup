# Crystal Golems

Golems are sentient masses of crystal that reached a critical mass of power where the power crystallizes into an intelligence. These creatures form when enough individual crystals (the amount varies with the inherent magic in the crystals) touch to form a sentience. These creatures range from barely intelligent to fully sentient as they gain more crystal mass. The existence of these creatures makes storing large amounts of crystal difficult, as your pile of gems might get up and walk away.
#### Feral Golems
These golems are completely natural in occurrence, usually caused by a rock slide or a cave-in Feral golems can be found rarely wandering [[The Below]]. Unlike most other golems that get smarter with age, these feral golems only get more irritable the larger they get.
#### Charge Golems
These golems are helpful to Artifizers because the sentience will recharge crystals that are almost depleted, the golem is then killed and the crystals are harvested to be used again. These will sometimes be kept by traveling caravans due to the constant need for more gems to keep the caravan rolling. This would be an obvious choice for all caravans if the golems didn't have the strength of 5 oxen and the temperament of hungry toddlers.
#### Bank Golems
These golems are massive conglomerations of many different types of crystal and are kept safe in large bank vaults. Rather than storing the crystal in small heavily guarded boxes to keep them from coming to like banks simply add crystals to massive golems. The crystals of these golems are sorted into like piles before they are added to the golem resulting in an almost calico patterning. These golems range in size according to the bank and how many vaults they split their gems into. The largest bank golem is found in [[Jodath]] standing at 30 feet tall, and will beat esteemed guests in games of chess.
#### Pet Golems
Made of powerful stones of a single type these golems can be any shape, some even created by artists as walking art pieces. The more powerful the crystal the smaller the golem can be but the smallest one created was roughly the size of a saint bernard and could learn only a few commands.
## Advanced Golems +
These Golems delicately crafted by extremely talented members of the [[Artifizer's Guild]] are more works of art than works of [[Artifizing]] or magic. These golems are crafted in sections just small enough to not become golems themselves, then they are assembled into purpose-built golems. This can include golems shaped like carts that roll themselves along with their arms. Golems that are equipped with limbs fit to specific tasks. Some of these artful golems are even made in the likeness of people and are able to learn facial expressions.
#### Art Golems
 Living pieces of art usually used to show off wealth but very occasionally incredibly cool
#### Guard Golems
Custom made for [[Dolorem]] these menacing golems are made with [[Artifizing|artifizal]] sonic cannons mounted to them and will prove excessively lethal if provoked
#### Job Golems
 Various jobs can be automated with golem power, these golems can be humanoid but typically aren't, sometimes in very prestigious establishments job golems and art golems are one in the same
