Spiders that were created by [[Cujokra]], enhanced by [[Kesk]], and tamed by the [[Akari]], these horse-sized spiders now serve as mounts for [[Akari]] Riders and [[Euchari]] fishers. They possess the ability to fly on massive insect wings, as well as the ability to float on water and use their webs between their front legs which acts as a sail, allowing them to stay on expeditions much longer. They also possess remarkably tough exoskeletons, highly toxic venom, and amazing strength.
