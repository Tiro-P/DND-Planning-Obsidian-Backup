Long winding vines curling around nothing but air these ancient plants merged with the power of [[Gem Magic]] through processes akin to [[Stonesinging]] or [[Plantsinging]] have developed their own sentience and their own shape. These creatures are not of [[Tataluk]] but have gained their minds through similar means. Fluent in basic arcana these creatures can be a force of good, evil, or completely neutral acting on whims that they have. They take the form of long twisting vines gathered into a vaguely lizard shaped head. The only place you can see the glow of their [[Gem Magic]] is in their glowing eyes, making them incredible ambush predators in forests or jungles if they so wish.
