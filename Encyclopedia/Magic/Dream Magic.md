## Threads
- the title dream magic feels not great because dreams are typically thought of as the alternative to nightmares so maybe sommicience (stemming from omniscience) or some other title like night talking would fit better, or have a lunaris name for it and call the rest nightmare magic since only the lunaris use it for not malice maybe they refer to using it as "walking the nighttime path" or "seeing the night time path " based on wether it's for guidance or prophecy
