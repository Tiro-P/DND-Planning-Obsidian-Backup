## Info
- Specialty:
	- Deals, and binding fate
- Traditions:
	- Strong deals. These are deals made with strong beings like [[Tezrian born]] or [[The Mad Witch]]. these entities are able to unravel the warp and weft of fate and reweave it with new tensions twisting its shape to their whims. 
		- in a deal such as these the cost is rarely shared with the petitioner, but as with most things, the cost is proportional to the ask
	- Fate ties these are more commonly used by the [[Eeleerie]]  unlike Deals that bend fate to an end, Fate ties can weave together ones fate with others.  an example of this being used is in the [[Eeleerie]] wedding ritual. where as the final part of the wedding ceremony the two [[Eeleerie]] intertwine their fates, assuring that if lost they will always find their way back together. 
- Gifted Races:
	- [[Eeleerie]]

- Source:
	-  Wielders of fate pull on strings established by [[Muerin]] before they met their own fate at the hands of the [[Tezrian]]
