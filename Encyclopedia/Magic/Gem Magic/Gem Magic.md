# Overview
All gems have the ability to contain a small taste of godlike power. When in gems this power causes the gems to glow softly with a slowly tumbling, living light. Due to the ability to contain this power, large masses of gems are sometimes able to form basic consciousnesses in a manner similar to [[Tataluk|Tataluk’s]] apotheosis but on a significantly smaller scale. This phenomena can result in the existence of [[Crystal Golems]]
- [[Heart Gems]] are the preferred crystal to work gem magic with because being a part of [[Tataluk]] they are more harmonious with life than other gems and so they gain energy faster and are capable storing more of the energy as well.

*There are two main ways of manipulating the magic stored inside gems.* 
- Using The Resonance to connect the energy in the gem to your own energy and utilizing the power as an extension of yourself
- Using [[Artifizing]] a scientific technique developed by the [[Jodin]] that uses frequencies dissonant to the Resonance to “denature” the magic within the crystal allowing the stripped energy to flow out and into whatever contraption they have devised. Energy used by Artifizing will not return to the resonance and once a crystal has been drained of energy it will crack or shatter, becoming dull and unable to hold any more magic.
## The Resonance
The resonance is the presence of [[Tataluk]] in the life and crystals of the world and through connecting to this presence the magic contained inside of charged gems can be manipulated
- Beings who are entirely crystal such as [[Firsthewn]] or [[Secondhewn]] have an innate connection to the Resonance so strong that their lifes depend on a strong conduit for The Resonance this also applies for the wholly [[Heart Gems|Heart Gem]] [[Kaokrin]] and for any of the [[Talacri]] 
	- If any of these creatures (Excluding [[Firsthewn]]) are away from a strong node of The Resonance such as [[The Heartlands]], [[The Bluewoods]] or any of the [[Scattered Taluk Shards]] they will start to feel faint, ill, and eventually pass away
	- All of these strongly connected creatures if they die while at a strong node they will dissolve into the crystal, their essence joining The Resonance and their experiences feeding the power of these locations
- Beings that are not naturally in tune with The Resonance can still connect to it albeit in a slightly more limited fashion 
	- Beings that have [[Heart Gems|Heart Gem]] transplants connected to them through [[Taluk Healing]] can interact with resonance in different ways influenced by the nature of their transplant.
		- The variance in the way those with Gem transplants interact with the resonance is very similar to how [[Stonefauna]] interact with it
	- Even those who do not have crystal as a part of their body can have resonators made of [[Heart Gems|Heart Gem]] with [[Stonesinging]] that will allow them to connect the magic in gems to their magic and use it very similarly to a [[Secondhewn]]
