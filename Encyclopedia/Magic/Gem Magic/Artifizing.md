a scientific technique developed by the [[Jodin]] that uses frequencies dissonant to the Resonance to “denature” the magic within the crystal allowing the stripped energy to flow out and into whatever contraption they have devised. Energy used by Artifizing will not return to the resonance and once a crystal has been drained of energy it will crack or shatter, becoming dull and unable to hold any more magic.

- This use of the energy stored in gems, with no respect for where it came from, is seen as abhorrent to [[The Council of the Firsthewn]] 
- Although any crystal can be used the Artifizers tend to prefer [[Heart Gems]] as they last longer and will gain power faster when used with a [[Crystal Golems#Charge Golems|Charge Golem]] 
	- Opalescent [[Heart Gems]], when used properly, can massively improve a piece of Artifizing or make what would otherwise be impossible possible. The proper use for each individual opalescence is a bit of a mystery to the [[Jodin]] as they are unaware of the purpose of the colors within [[Gem Magic#The Resonance|The Resonance]] so its mostly educated trial and error.
