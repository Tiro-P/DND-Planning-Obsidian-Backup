The "flesh" of [[Tataluk]]
What [[Firsthewn]] and [[Secondhewn]] are made of as well as a big part of [[The Heartlands]]
can be charged by life energy
the best material for any [[Gem Magic]]


Many of the [[Heart Gems]] of Tataluk still contain traces of their primordial power. This power can be utilized in 2 manners, through The Resonance or through [[Artifizing]]. 
There is variation within [[Heart Gems]] found in the mountains of [[The Heartlands]] displayed in the opalescence of the crystal. There are 3 colors mirroring those of the [[Firsthewn]] and [[Mountain Beasts]] red, blue and green. For stone singing only [[Firsthewn]] can resonate with these gems as their song is more demanding and complex. The highest level of [[Artifizing|Artifizers]] say that matching a opalescent [[Heart Gems|Heart Gem]] with the proper task is of utmost importance. Some artificers may have even found ways to create new colors of opalescence on crystals such as purple and cyan. The existence of such crystals is viewed with great concern by the [[The Council of the Firsthewn]] because such a crystal would not represent any part of The Resonance known to them.

There are 3 natural colors this opalescence can take Red, Green and Blue, each is linked to different qualities of the Resonance as seen by the Taluk. Red is the color of Rhythm a constant beating pulse that flows through everything. Green is the color of Melody, the flow of life over and among the Rhythm. and Blue is the hardest color to explain to a non Taluk, but it is best described as the color of Composition, not the combination of the other two but the ever changing direction of the Resonance.

Found: [[The Heartlands]] [[Scattered Taluk Shards]] living Gem creatures

Cost: if not replenished each gem has limited power, the [[Firsthewn]] don't like it being used by outsiders, hard to find the resonance if you aren't Taluk
