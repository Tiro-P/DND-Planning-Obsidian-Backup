A silvery metal made of moonlight by the [[Nirnaeth]] and used almost exclusively by them

Created and shaped only through [[Isil weaving]] reacts very poorly with blood in its untempered form

Cost: [[Nirnaeth]] are pretty gatekeepy about it and it can only be made by those with [[Cujokra]]'s "blessing"
