## Threads
- Ethum starts as plain black void with white stars, as it ages it will pick up more colors from the starborn around it
- Made by [[Astarte]] to give the [[Starborn]] a taste of his power it is basically the trial version of creation magic
	- Ethum can take on properties of different materials but is always ethum
	- Ethum users skill determines how easy it is to reshape what they have made
- The amount of Ethum scales to the amount of creatives that would use it
	- Astarte made it so that people could make stories with it, if there are less people that can use it well there will be less Ethum
- Ethum when used, overtime becomes more attuned to its user, getting easier to use by them and harder to be used by others.
	- this can continue through generations, the Ethum will adopt the colors and patterning of its users over a long period of time
		- This applies to the scale of buildings
	- This attument does not limit the ability of the Ethum to take other shapes or be used by other craftspeople but it “tints” the creation more towards what the Ethum has been historically used for
- Ethum once in a shape can be reshaped by others however more skilled craftspeople’s work will require an equally skilled craftsperson to dismantle
- Ethum is made by Astarte to assist creatives this can be gained either through having great passion to create or seek knowledge or stories, or through ritual to Astarte requesting a blessing.
- Working with ethum is cooperative, it works to give a craftperson’s vision shape into the world. the power that a craftsperson using ethum can draw from it is proportional to their inspiration and talent
- If Ethum is left alone for long enough without creation and passion it will begin to melt, slowly turning back into a puddle of Ethum
	- this can be as short as 1 years for a sword to start melting and 30 years for a building sized object to start melting depending on its use before being abandoned
