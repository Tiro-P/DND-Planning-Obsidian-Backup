## Threads
- Made by [[Astarte]] to give the [[Starborn]] a taste of his power it is basically the trial version of creation magic
	- Ethum can take on properties of different materials but is always ethum
	- Ethum users skill determines how easy it is to reshape what they have made
- The amount of Ethum scales to the amount of creatives that would use it
	- Astarte made it so that people could make stories with it, if there are less people that can use it well there will be less Ethum
- Ethum when used, overtime becomes more attuned to its user, getting easier to use by them and harder to be used by others.
	- this can continue through generations, the Ethum will adopt the colors and patterning of its users over a long period of time
- This attument does not limit the ability of the ethum to take other shapes but it “tints” the creation more towards what it has been historically used for
