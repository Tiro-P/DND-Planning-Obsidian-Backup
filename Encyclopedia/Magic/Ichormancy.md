The art of feeding arcane magic into [[Ichor]] to empower it and keep the user somewhat safe developed by the [[Ichormancers]]
## Info
- Specialty:
	- Spell amplification, wild magic
- Traditions:
	- Ichormancy generally is the "art" of using ichor as a catalyst for magic, warping the spell and draining the light out of it to create more disastrous effects
	- The [[Akari]] are the most natural users of [[Ichormancy]] utilizing chitinous flasks full of ichor, and Ichormancy they can coat their limbs or bodies, allowing them to make weapons out of it and use it for defense, this also increases their height up to 5-6ft. this is easily the riskiest thing an Ichormancer can do with ichor as it requires direct contact with ichor and not just dissolving the physical form of the Akari but also having to reconstruct it after.
		- Non Akari races if they are very talented, can also assume this ichor coated war form using [[Ichormancy]] but exiting it and reforming their body afterwards is extremely difficult.
- Gifted Races:
	-  roughly 2% of [[Akari]] are skilled at [[Ichormancy]]
- Source:
	- the Akari figured out how to use [[Ichormancy]] by themselves but see it as a gift from [[Akar, The Vast]]
- Age:
	- Ichormancy was first discovered by the [[Akari]] in [[Timeline#0AB|0AB]] but it took them 700 years to figure out how to use it without being destroyed
