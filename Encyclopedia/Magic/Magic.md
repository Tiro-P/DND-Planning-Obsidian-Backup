Types of magic ( how it's used )
- ritual 
	- Takes a substantial amount of time to use it and has larger impacts
- material 
	- works either to create or manipulate a magical material that can be used by those without access to the magic albeit to a lower degree
- casting 
	- quick incantations that have immediate effects such as combat magic
- rules
	- a steadfast rule of existence that can't be directly used only worked with
	- Examples: oaths in LoTR where swearing an oath bends fate itself to make it happen

## general magic ideas dump 
### non canonized 
- questions
	- magic as a whole 
		- can new magic energy be made or is everyone scooping from the existing created pool of power that exists in the leylines or in other places (moon) (ichor pool)
			- 
	- ichor and ethum
		- does ichor mutate stuff? does it consume stuff or just corrupt? Like is it doing Akar stuff (eat) or Kesk stuff (make evil things)
		- is ichor only found? Or is it made somehow? The doc mentions pools of Kesk’s blood are the place to get it, how big would those be?
			- balance between commonality and power?
		- are there any similarities between ethum and ichor other than being the primary magical material of a primordial god?
		- can ethum be blighted? Does that change it other than visually?
			- Ethum can be blighted it will try to avoid it but it'll separate back into mundane material and it will be divested of its magic
			- ik one of the main downsides of being blighted is you can't use ethum is it like a magnetic repelling force thing or does it get destroyed or just not cooperate?
				- It actively avoids them like two same charged magnets and is uncooperative with them
		- does ethum have it's own inherent power or is it just a conduit/amplifier for it's users. Like paint can be pretty but it isn't inherently artistic. Or is it like divine inspiration kinda like the magic equivalent of those bladeless “air multiplier” fans
		- ethum crafting is either a religious style blessing of clay (any other materials?) or scientific methods and discovery 
			- is that like having things around the lab that'll turn to ethum when they find something cool?
			- Ethum is made by Astarte to assist creatives 
		- ethum can be used for any medium of art, are there different types of ethum? Or does it change at will between ink and paint and clay. 
- [[Isil]] 
	- solidified moonlight **very dense magic**, magic made solid, not just solid magic. Can't be used to cast directly 
		-  [[ley line magic]] gravitational warping? distorting teleportation and shuppy navigation
			- Physically bends other magic?
			- in large quantities distorts magic effects around it?
		- i kinda like the idea of it being so dense it's more magic proof than magical in practice but it is a magic so maybe it can be made into very thin filaments and made into dreamcatcher like weavings that can hold/modify spells?
		- the summoning process usually includes sealing the Isil, putting extra effort into smoothing the outside of it so it won't come undone
			- sealed Isil 
				- very shiny almost glows
				- strong, metallic and light,
				- despite looking metallic makes noises like it's made of silk?
				- due to connection to dream magic, isil leaves brilliant afterimage trails when seen using any form of divination
			- unsealed Isil 
				- part of the creation of any Isil good
				- very concentrated moonlight, kinda angry, reacts strongly with blood
					- this specifically sucks when getting a Isil tattoo 
				- gradually leaks? Shrinks? hollows out? Adds balance to unsealed weapons and adds more skill to weaving it because you'd have to do it just right to control the output or it would dissolve
				- can harm incorporeal things.
					- nightmare slicer??
	- it lets the Nirnaeth ships float somehow.
		- Is it just straight anti gravity or like floating via displacement on magic currents
		- are the ships fully isil? Or just the hulls or sails? 
		- are they full on like beef Spanish vessel or closer to like the big canoe/ viking long boat slender shape 
			- ooo do they leave a wake of moonlight ripples 
		- Do the ships work better with exposure to the moon?
	- are the Nirnaeth gatekeepy with it because of religion or tradition? Or are they business people keeping a monopoly?
		- are they even gatekeepy?
	- is the blood moon responsible for allowing the creation of the pearls that allow isil creation Kesk’s or an unrelated cujokra thing?
	- using it looks effortless and is fast enough to be useful in battle by a talented weaver
	- can be created in rough shapes and refined from there, the doc didn't say if that's through magic or normal tools
- non material magics
	- empathy magic
		- it's only use is healing, physical and non physical wounds
		- can the empathy connection be used to detect lies or emotions? 
		- are all balulu able to do it a little or do they have to train or unlock it somehow 
		- balulu magic based on comfort and rejuvenation, polulu magic based on security, and warmth. 
			- both can do either but they specialize a bit due to their situations
