Types of magic ( how it's used )
- ritual 
	- Takes a substantial amount of time to use it and has larger impacts
- material 
	- works either to create or manipulate a magical material that can be used by those without access to the magic albeit to a lower degree
- casting 
	- quick incantations that have immediate effects such as combat magic
- rules
	- a steadfast rule of existence that can't be directly used only worked with
	- Examples: oaths in LoTR where swearing an oath bends fate itself to make it happen
