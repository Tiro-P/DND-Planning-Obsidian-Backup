Similar to the [[Balulu]] in form but live in a colder climate need to find more ways to differentiate
Although simmilar to their cousins the Polulu arent as quickly trusting and will be slow to put their faith in strangers. However once you have their trust they will defend you with an intensity quite unlike the kind care of a Balulu
