## Threads
- They use the [[Selenae]] to fish, taking advantage of their ability to stand on water. They weave the [[Selenae|Selenae’s]] webs into a sail between their front legs to sail
- The Euchari descend from an Akari special mission sent by [[Akar, The Vast]] in the time before [[The Glass Wars]]. That special mission found their way to [[The Hometree (biome)]] and because of low rations and energy, had to set up a camp at the base of the tree. For a long time they were Unaware of the [[T'keen]] civilization developing in the tree above them. Gradually what was originally a camp grew into a small city and the [[Akari]] inhabiting it slowly diverged from their predatory ancestors, becoming a peaceful self sustaining society and metamorphosizing into the [[Euchari]].
