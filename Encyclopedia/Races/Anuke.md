	Tiny characters take up a space of 2-1/2 feet by 2-1/2 feet, so up to four of these characters can fit into a single square. 
	Tiny races typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can’t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent’s square to attack it in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. Other creatures can move through those squares without provoking attacks of opportunity.
	Tiny creatures typically cannot flank an enemy.
**Swarming (1 RP)**
	Anuke are used to living and fighting communally with others of their race. Up to two Anuke can share the same square at the same time. 
	If two members of this race that are occupying the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
**Mycanoid (5 RP)**
	Anuke are made of living fungal matter are immune to the effects of poison, Mycanoid creatures do not need sleep, but can benefit from it, such as regaining spell slots.
	If a creature ingests any part of a mycanoid they must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or become confused for 1d4 rounds as they trip balls.
## Threads
