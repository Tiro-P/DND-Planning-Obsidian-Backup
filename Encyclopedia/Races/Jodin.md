New Jodin are made by one or more Jodin thinking out loud in the same area for long periods of time till the rocks wanna learn and manifest into a Jodin, they are infectious curiosity made manifest. This also helps to manufacture their own echo chambers pretty easy leading to groups with no morals sometimes 

Jodin are rocks that became so curious the generate their own resonance, this is his they live, powered by their own living they are motivated to live to their fullest. For this same reason they cannot charge heart gems or other crystals as all their resonance is used internally. 
The only way a Jodin naturally dies is if they are not living, if they loose their curiosity of reason to keep going. 
Most Jodin have high levels of respect and a feeling of kinship with crystals and the resonance within, they find the cracking of a drained crystal a highly unpleasant sound and most will avoid it
