	- Any physical appearance they have is not all of them, as they are not fully in this “dimension” This can make their first form very disorienting to look at as they get used to 3d

Tezrian Born can take the place of any vanilla demons in functionality, or act as a form of wild magic, divine benefactor or other
## Threads
- Running theories of the [[Coursers]] include that some “folk gods” may have started out as one of the Born and then been molded by the beliefs of those around them.
