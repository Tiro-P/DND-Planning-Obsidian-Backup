	- Their skin dims from the vivid [[Starborn]] celestial colors down to overcast greys or stark whites, getting paler the further they fall
	- The typical starry constellations on a [[Starborn]] turn red and are scattered across them, the quantity of these red stars increase the further they fall to evil as well

## Threads
- A [[Starborn]] who has done no wrong can still become [[Blighted]] through [[Ichor]] corruption if they come into contact with it
- The deeds required to become a blighted are quite severe for a [[Starborn]] making them relatively rare, less than one in a thousand [[Starborn]] will ever become [[Blighted]]
- [[Blighted]] aren't created out of [[Astarte|Astarte's]] hate, they are created due to [[Astarte|Astarte's]] love of heroes. when a [[Starborn]] falls far enough from good that they can no longer conceivably achieve the role of a hero they become a [[Blighted]]
- They can become redeemed but it has to be done by a massive act such as finding [[The Skybrand]]
