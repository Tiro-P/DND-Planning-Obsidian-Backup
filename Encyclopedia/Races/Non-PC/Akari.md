## Threads
- They reproduce by laying eggs and mature extremely quickly
- A group of [[Akari]] that were separated on a stealth mission to [[The Hometree (biome)]] became the [[Euchari]], a good race meaning Akari may not be naturally evil and its just the presence of [[Akar, The Vast]] that keeps them that way.
