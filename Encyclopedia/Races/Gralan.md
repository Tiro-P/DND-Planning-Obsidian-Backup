## Threads
- The Gralan are a subrace of the [[Gravan]] that adapted to exist in [[The Blood Desert]], however due to the consolidation of [[Gravan]] and Gralan cities of [[Ruins of Cragola|Cragola]] and [[Ruins of Lithrak|Lithrak]] into the underground city [[Cragolith]], the distinction today is only made as a point of heritage.
