## Threads
- when Fweedoon have particularly troublesome or joyous times in their life they will intone these feelings into a plant of their choosing, this process will cause the plant to grow around the shape of their feelings like a tree around a fence. These plants will often be sung into the flora of [[The Bluewoods]] feeding the [[Gem Magic|Resonance]]. When a flowering plant is used for this purpose it creates the most beautiful blooms one can find in all of Aurelia.
	- these plants, when mature, feed the resonance in a manner similar to fertilizing an area of a garden. they can speed up the passive accumulation of [[Gem Magic]] in crystals nearby.
- The Fweedoon are mostly nocturnal when living in [[The Bluewoods]] they sleep on the [[Canopy Strider]] during the day and once the light of the [[Blue Moon]] floods [[The Heartlands]] they run and dance beneath the feet of the Strider, singing to the foliage of [[The Bluewoods]] feeding the [[Gem Magic|Resonance]]
