- when fweedoon have particularly troublesome or joyous times in their life they will intone these feelings into a plant of their choosing, this will cause the plant to grow around the shape of their feelings like a tree around a fence. These plants will often be sung into the flora of [[The Bluewoods]] feeding the [[Gem Magic|Resonance]]. When a blooming plant is used for this purpose it creates the most beautiful blooms one can find in all of Aurelia.
