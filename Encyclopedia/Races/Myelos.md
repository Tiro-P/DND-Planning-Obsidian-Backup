this race uses INT for Heal
### Grafting
#### Checks
- Heal checks are used to graft parts on to a Myelos' or another consenting Myelos
- Craft (harvest) checks are used to harvest parts off of non conscious Myelos creatures. DC will always be 10+2CR
- There is no check for Myelos to remove their own limbs, removed limbs are destroyed unless they are Forma
- There is no int penalty when replacing a limb with an identical one just a nat 1 check
#### Major Organs
- Installation:
	- Forma Major Organs:
		- requires a Heal check with a DC of 10 + 2 for every limb over 4 limbs for forma organs 
		- Fail would take 1 week, success would take 3 days 10 over DC would take 5 hrs of -2 int
	- Harvested Major Organs: 
		- requires a Heal check with a DC of 10 + 2 for every limb over 4 limbs + 2(CR of the limb)
		-  fail would take 2 weeks to recover, success would take 1 week, and  10 over the DC would take 3 days of -4 int
- useable major organs are limited by Int level, every 3 Int after 10 allows for another additional limb
	- 10 int 4 Major Organs
	- 13 int 5 Major Organs
	- 16 int 6 Major Organs
	- 19 int 7 Major Organs
	- 22 int 8 Major Organs
- Stat increase
- additional limbs
#### Minor Organs 
- Installation: Requires a Heal check DC 10 for Forma organs or 10+2CR for harvested organs
	- Forma: Heal check DC 10. 3 days on fail 1 on success instant on 10 over DC of -1 int
	- Harvested: Heal check DC 10+2CR, 1 week on fail, 3 days on success 1 day on 10 over DC of -2 int
- Environmental adaptations
- Skill adaptations
#### Preservation of Organs 
- Forma Medium
	- Parts fully submerged in medium will be preserved indefinitely 
- Attaching a limb to you but don't interface with it 
	- gives -2 Con until removed but incurs no Int damage



## Threads
- some groups use the same modifications like a uniform.
- They have a cultural tradition of spontaneous coordinated song and dance
	- This seems to suggest a (likely vestigial) hivemind relationship in the species
- When a Myelos dies it shrivels into a ball that looks like its made of tree roots, its common to carve this into a statue or turn it into jewelry
