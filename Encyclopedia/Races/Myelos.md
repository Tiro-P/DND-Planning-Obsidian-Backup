Born as gnarled creatures of roughly humanoid shape, Myelos are able to remove their own body parts, exposing a living nerve core that can attach to body parts harvested from other creatures.
## Society Info
- Age of Race:
	- Created: 300BB
	- Age as of current day: 1220 years
- Home Region:
	- [[Virullen]]
- Capital and Cities:
	- Their former capital, [[Ruins of Krov|Krov]], was destroyed. 
	- A majority of the population now lives in [[Illureth]]
- Common Occupations:
	- A Myelos is adaptable to any job, sometimes tailoring themselves to work efficiently
	- Myelos are innately equipped to understand the mechanisms of organic life, and commonly work as public healers, private physicians, or apothecaries and herbalists. 
	- [[Forma]] Technician is a job that is *almost* exclusively occupied by expert [[Myelos]] craftsmen. 
- Standings with other races:
	- The [[Myelos]] and [[Cha'rell]] are very close, regarding each other as siblings
## Description
- Lifespan: Highest age is 150 years, 80 years on average
- Physical Description:
	- Myelos are born with a vaguely humanoid shape that looks like its made of snarled tree roots. about 2 years old they gain the ability to graft and from there they take wildly different appearances, ranging from 4-8ft tall and any shape imaginable.
	- Since the advent of Forma, and their proximity to the Cha'rell, the average Myelos looks more like the other sentient races of the world, with exotic grafts becoming fashion/symbolic statements.
- Temperament:
	- Myelos tend to naturally adopt the behavioral and emotional characteristics of their grafts in a manner akin to how a [[Mippieps]] animal features may reflect in their personality. This has less effect on their personality as they age. 
	- Early Myelos were bestial in their behavior, which after some internal conflicts between  tribes eventually developed into a strict and complex system of etiquette, until the fall of Krov. 
	- After the destruction of Krov, and displacement to Illureth, the Myelos have largely come together as a single people, and are on friendly terms with other races. 
- Affinities
	- Myelos have the ability to adapt nearly any kind of living tissue to themselves
	- They are experts in the fields of biology, physiology and anatomy

## Threads
- Some groups use the same modifications like a uniform 
- Their language, Mylotic, consists of rhythmic grunts and plosives, allowing many mouths to communicate. 
- They have a cultural tradition of spontaneous coordinated song and dance
	- This seems to suggest a (likely vestigial) hivemind relationship in the species
- When a Myelos dies it shrivels into a shape similar in appearance to tree roots, its common to carve this into a statue or turn it into jewelry

### Grafting
Myelos body parts age at a rate respective to the support systems in place for their organs
#### Checks
- Heal checks are used to graft parts on to a Myelos' or another consenting Myelos
- Craft (harvest) checks are used to harvest parts off of non conscious Myelos creatures. DC will always be 10+2CR
- There is no check for Myelos to remove their own limbs, removed limbs are destroyed unless they are Forma
- There is no int penalty when replacing a limb with an identical one just a nat 1 check
#### Major Organs
- Installation:
	- Forma Major Organs:
		- requires a Heal check with a DC of 10 + 2 for every limb over 4 limbs for forma organs 
		- Fail would take 1 week, success would take 3 days 10 over DC would take 5 hrs of -2 int
	- Harvested Major Organs: 
		- requires a Heal check with a DC of 10 + 2 for every limb over 4 limbs + 2(CR of the limb)
		-  fail would take 2 weeks to recover, success would take 1 week, and  10 over the DC would take 3 days of -4 int
- useable major organs are limited by Int level, every 3 Int after 10 allows for another additional limb
	- 10 int 4 Major Organs
	- 13 int 5 Major Organs
	- 16 int 6 Major Organs
	- 19 int 7 Major Organs
	- 22 int 8 Major Organs
- Stat increase
- additional limbs
#### Minor Organs 
- Installation: Requires a Heal check DC 10 for Forma organs or 10+2CR for harvested organs
	- Forma: Heal check DC 10. 3 days on fail 1 on success instant on 10 over DC of -1 int
	- Harvested: Heal check DC 10+2CR, 1 week on fail, 3 days on success 1 day on 10 over DC of -2 int
- Environmental adaptations
- Skill adaptations
#### Preservation of Organs 
- Forma Medium
	- Parts fully submerged in medium will be preserved indefinitely 
- Attaching a limb to you but don't interface with it 
	- gives -2 Con until removed but incurs no Int damage
