```ad-quote
Culatan is one of the six legendary sea leviathans. Culatan resembles a chimeric creature with a draconic upper body but a squidlike lower body. Its draconic upper body has the standard torso and front arms of a dragon while its lower body consists of hundreds of squid tentacles. Culatan is an extremely docile creature that only shows itself to the most successful sailors and trade capitols of the world. Culatan is the most infrequently seen sea leviathan. Culatan is a lawful good entity whose infrequent sightings foretell good fortune and bountiful life.
