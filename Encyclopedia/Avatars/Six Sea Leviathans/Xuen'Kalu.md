Chaotic neutral omen of Joy and adventure
One of the [[Six Sea Leviathans]]
Hundreds of miles long sea serpent covered in jagged scales
Spends time fucking with [[Ishull Beasts]] and nudging entire port  cities

```ad-quote
Xuen'kalu is one of the six legendary sea leviathans. This leviathan most closely resembles its previous ouroboros form as it is a massive sea serpent. Xuen'kalu is multiple hundreds of miles long and is covered in countless sharp protrusions and jagged armored scales. Xuen'kalu is chaotic neutral and spends a decent amount of its time playfully nudging entire port cities andÂ Ishull Beasts. Witnessing Xuen'kalu foretells great joy and adventure.
