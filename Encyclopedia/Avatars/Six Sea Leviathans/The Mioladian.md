The Mioladian is one of the [[Six Sea Leviathans|six legendary sea leviathans]]. The Mioladian is a massive sea monster made entirely of coral. Resembling a slight humanoid form, this creature looks like a multi-mile tall coral golem. This creature is incredibly docile, hardly moving from its residence around the [[Neplora]] capital city of [[Nelagi]]. The Mioladian hardly interacts with land-dwelling races and spends most of its time sustaining the [[Shifting Reefs]]. The Mioladian is a true neutral creature whose presence foretells progress and stability.
