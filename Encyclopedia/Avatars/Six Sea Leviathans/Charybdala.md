Docile omen of sickness and misfortune
One of the [[Six Sea Leviathans]]
Massive Jellyfish with a buncha eyes on top of its bell
seen at smaller pirate ports or the [[Ishull Beasts]]

```ad-quote
Charybdala is one of the six legendary sea leviathans. This monstrous creature resembles a massive blighted jellyfish with millions of ever-watching eyes atop its bell. 
This creature is mostly docile making appearances near smaller pirate ports andÂ Ishull Beasts.
Witnessing Charybdala foretells misfortune and great sickness for sailors.
