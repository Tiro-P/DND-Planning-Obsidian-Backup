Evil and Chaotic omen of storms
One of the [[Six Sea Leviathans]]
Massive isopod/millipede
said to appear at ports before a storm

```ad-quote
Calad’galereth is one of the six legendary sea leviathans. Calad’galereth resembles a massive isopodous millipede with millions of twisted jagged legs and a horrifically tooth-filled maw. Calad'galereth is a moderatly docile creature, only apearing before the biggest port cities during great storms. Calad’galereth is chaotic evil and it foretells violent storms and agonizing pain.
