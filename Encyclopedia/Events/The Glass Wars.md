## Threads
- [[Xrell]] was taken at the very start of the war and was not reclaimed until 20 years later using a [[Zharash]] war camp in the [[The Holy Sands]] and a supporting force of starborn
- at some point [[Funky Head 3]] was taken captive by the Akari but reclaimed by a [[Zharash]] war party 
- after the fighting had subsided and the [[Akari]] swarm stopped pushing towards [[The Hometree (biome)]] the remaining 3 [[Starborn]] armies were used as the foundation for [[The Blazing Blade]] 
- As retaliation for loosing the war [[Kesk]] struck out and glassed the [[Eeleerie]] city of [[Ruins of Teerai|Teerai]] making the [[Eeleerie]] move to the [[Eastern Atolls]]
- The war also made the [[Zharash]] start living underground, abandaning the surface city of [[Xrell]] and expanding its catacombs into a whole second city
- as a result of the war the [[Secondhewn]] city of [[Tastora]] becomes adept at healing to help veterans of the war recover
