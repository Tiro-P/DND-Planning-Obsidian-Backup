## Overview
- Heavily connected to the [[Order of the Starstrider]] but also has families of lesser spirits.
	- In terms of spirit hierarchy the [[Eeleerie]] would not have a written established one as not to draw the ire of any spirits but Astarte would be the most commonly worshiped among them as their creator
- Households will regularly have small shrines to the spirits represented in the family and their careers. 
- Any interaction between practitioners and spirits is based around equal respect and reciprocity. The practitioner respects the spirit with the spirits preferred ritual or food or drink ect and the spirit respects the practitioner with protection and guidance. 
- **Spirits
	- Spirits can be either representations of natural forces, Personifications of concepts, or highly esteemed people who have now passed (such as those portrayed in [[The Skybrand]]). 
	- Spirits fall under various families based on similarities in the spirits' respective domains. They often contain similarly tempered spirits and their rituals often share similarities
	- Spirits can be attracted in numerous ways that vary based on the spirit, and what the practitioner wants from them. 
	- Spirits can be prayed to for help and guidance or “mounted” to a practitioner to directly affect the physical world
	- Spirit temperament can vary across the board with some being forgiving or benevolent and others being malicious or vengeful if slighted.
